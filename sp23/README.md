Welcome to CS2051 Spring 2023! This semester, the course is taught synchronously with CS 2050. Historically, there hasn't been any programming in this class; however, since it is a CS course, we'll be trying out a few programming questions this semester.

I (Sarthak) will be handling all the coding supplements. Nithya will be handling all the math-only supplements. If you have quetsion about the supplements, please redirect them to the correct person.
