Welcome to CS2051 Spring 2023! This semester, the course is taught synchronously with CS 2050. Historically, there hasn't been any programming in this class; however, since it is a CS course, we'll be trying out a few programming questions this semester.

Sarthak will be handling all the coding supplements. Nithya will be handling all the math-only supplements. If you have any questions about the supplements, please redirect them to the correct person (emails are in the syllabus)

p.s. sorry for so many commits, right now this repository is connected with overleaf through a bridge that doesn't currently support branching.
