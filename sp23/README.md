# CS2051 Spring 2023

Welcome to CS2051 Spring 2023! This semester, the course is taught synchronously with CS 2050. In contrast to past semesters, we'll be trying out a few programming questions this time (it is a CS course after all!)

**Course Coordinators:**
- Sarthak: Handling all coding supplements. 
- Nithya: Responsible for all math-only supplements. 

Please redirect your questions about the supplements to the appropriate person. Find their emails in the syllabus.

> **Note:** We apologize for the numerous commits. The repository is currently linked with Overleaf via a [bridge](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization) which does not support branching.
