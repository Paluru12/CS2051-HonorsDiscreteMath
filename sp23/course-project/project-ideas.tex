%Some projects are dealing with advanced ideas. Understanding, even partially, one such proofs is considered satisfactory work. Students should aim to offer classmates an overview of the problem, some ideas of the proof and anything else they are capable of achieving.

\section*{Example}

\subsection*{Linear Diophantine Equations}
    A \textit{linear Diophantine equation} is an equation of the form $$a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + \dots + a_{n}x_{n} = c$$ where $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}, c \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    In the course, we considered the case when $n = 2$ and asked when the equation $ax + by = c$ has an integral solution. We proved that a solution exists if and only if $\gcd(a, b) \mid c$, or else no solution exists -- this was B\'ezout's Lemma. However, we didn't develop a way of \textit{finding} the solution.
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    One method to find a solution is to reverse the Euclidean algorithm (see page 131 in the text). The aim of this project is to classify \textit{all} solutions to such an equation. This leads us to the following main result:
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    \textbf{Theorem.} Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$, let $d = \gcd(a, b)$ and suppose that $d \mid c$. Let $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ be a fixed integral solution to the equation $ax + by = c$. A pair of integers $(x, y)$ is a solution to the equation if and only if $$x = x_{0} + k \cdot \frac{b}{d} \text{\quad and\quad} y = y_{0} - k \cdot \frac{a}{d}$$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    A couple of possible areas for extension or generalizations are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the case where the coefficients and solutions to the equation $ax + by = c$ are required to be \textit{natural numbers} -- that is, we fix $a, b, c \in \mathbb{N}$ and ask when natural number solutions $x, y$ to the equation $ax + by = c$ exist. When $a$ and $b$ are coprime, it is know that the least value of $c$ for which no natural number solution exists is $ab - a - b$. Prove this, and consider what happens when $a$ and $b$ are \textit{not} coprime.
        \item Consider the case when there are $n \ge 1$ variables, not necessarily exactly two variables - that is, consider an equation of the form $\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{k}x_{k} = c$ for some $n \ge 1$ and some $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}, c \in \mathbb{Z}$. Generalize B\'ezout's lemma to this case; this will require that you define a notion of greatest common divisor for collections of $n$ integers, and then find a prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the equation $\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{k}x_{k} = x$ to have a solution.
    \end{itemize}
