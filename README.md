# CS2051: Honors Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

This repository contains information about CS 2051: Honors Discrete Mathematics at Georgia Tech. It is currently the main course page for the [Spring 2023](sp23/) section. The course structure is very different this semester, so please check the [README.md](sp23/README.md) and syllabus for the updated information.

If you're an instructor or a TA of an discrete mathematics course, feel free to use these resources for your classes! We only ask that you don't publicly release your solutions to these homeworks, in order to make this repository an effective teaching resource. If you'd like to know the solutions to any of the problems, please contact us.
