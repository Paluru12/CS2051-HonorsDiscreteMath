# CS2051: Honors Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

This repository contains information about CS 2051: Honors Discrete Mathematics at Georgia Tech. It is (usually) a completely separate course from CS 2050 (with the exception of [Spring 2023](sp23/)), covering additional breadth or depth in certain topics as compared to its standardized counterpart.

If you're an instructor or a TA of an discrete mathematics course, feel free to use these resources for your classes! We only ask that you don't publicly release your solutions to these homeworks, in order to make this repository an effective teaching resource. If you'd like to know the solutions to any of the problems, please contact us.
